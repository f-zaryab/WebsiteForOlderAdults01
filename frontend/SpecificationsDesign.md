# Design Guidelines
Main pointers are followed as instructed by [W3C guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/developing/)

Rest of the main points followed are as follows: 

1. [1.4.4 - Resize text (AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.0&showtechniques=144#resize-text) says “text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality”
  
   - [G142](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G142.html): Using a technology that has commonly-available user agents that support zoom

   - [C14](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C14.html): Using em units for font sizes.

   - [G146](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G146.html): Using liquid layout.

   - [G179](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/general/G179.html): Ensuring that there is no loss of content or functionality when the text resizes and text containers do not change their width.
